So if the US will be allowed to bully and force a company into selling if it wasn't to keep running as is, then why can't we have other countries get Meta to force to sell off Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp? The amount of information and data they control or have access to is probably far scarier, and pretty sure there was already that documentary about how they used that data to target and manipulate people before major elections... But no, apparently that's fine because it's all controlled in the US... If it somehow passes and does have to sell (which will be for billions), it shouldn't be allowed to go to yet another US based owner. \n\nNot to mention that the Internet is a global thing, and a VPN can get around these blocks. Making it fairly pointless trying to do this. Yes they try and adapt to make sure they're blocked, but then so do the VPN's.

Nobody's gonna do that, they'll just use a VPN. So it's a complete waste of time and money. \n\nAlso, if there's 170 million Americans on Tiktok.

Engineers invented a way to detect a hacker placing a probe on the circuit board to attempt to read digital traffic in a computer. Other researchers invented new ways to obfuscate electromagnetic emissions radiating from an active processor that might reveal its secrets. Still other groups created new ways for chips to generate their own unique digital fingerprints, ensuring their authenticity. And if even those are compromised, one team came up with a chip-fingerprint self-destruct scheme.', ""Been around since the 80's just not all that well known.\n\nN.

Talk about air rage.', 'I use it on planes because otherwise the antenna is hunting in vain for a cell signal and it just drains the battery faster.', 'I‚Äôve been a flight attendant for 40 years, so here is my insight into cellphones on airplanes.  \n\nTrue story, many years ago on a DC-9, so nowhere near the kind of electronics or technology we have on board newer aircraft these days, I was called to the flight deck and told that for some reason the navigation system was not operating as it should. (Don‚Äôt ask me, I don‚Äôt remember, or know what was wrong with it.)  \n\nThe pilots had consulted with the maintenance team, and they felt that it seemed to be some kind of interference. He told me that he was going to make an announcement asking everyone who had one, to double check their cell phones were not only in airplane mode, but turned off. \n\nHe made the announcement, and I would guess about 10-15 people took their phones out and switched them off, and showed me that they were powered off. \n\nThe problem with the navigation system disappeared.  The captain thanked everyone for cooperating, and we proceeded to our destination.  Later, he told me that we were on the verge of diverting to another city as the problem was making the navigation system unreliable. \n\nI have no proof other than the immediate cessation of the problem at the same time as the cellphones all being turned off. I have no idea what kind of interference it was, and again do not know what the ‚Äòproblem‚Äô was, nor with which navigation system.  It seemed  pure cause and effect. \n\nI can see where the regulations came from when cell phones first started being used frequently. \n\nFast forward to today. I know the phones no longer ‚Äòinterfere with aircraft systems.‚Äô  I forget to put mine in airplane mode all the time.  I get roaming notifications for counties I fly over at 37 000 ft. When I do this there is significant battery drain. Even if I‚Äôm on the plane‚Äôs wifi, which I am, my phone drains in hours. When I see I‚Äôve forgotten, however, I turn it to airplane mode immediately.  \n\nHOWEVER, it is still an Air Regulation in my country that they be turned to airplane mode while in flight. Movement is being made to allow cellphone use at all times, but we‚Äôre not there yet. \n\nFor those who are still saying ‚ÄòWhy do I have to turn it off it off, if it‚Äôs not harming anything?‚Äô  The  answer is:  You are harming yourself.

Eventually the law stepped in and mandated that they carry *all* messages, not just those from favoured speakers, and that they deliver them in the order in which they were received (so they couldn't provide *worse service* to disfavoured speakers.)\n\nIf they're publishers, like newspapers, then they can't be. That is well and truly settled law. Except social media platforms already aren't generally treated as publishers for a variety of purposes, most notably *liability*. They are not responsible for the messages carried on their platform, where publishers would be. They also typically accept all messages as their default position, posting anything submitted by a user unless there is a specific reason to block it (and typically only moderating *after* the message is posted), which is in contrast to traditional publishing that rejects by default, and only publishes select messages (articles, books, movies, letters to the editor, etc.) with prior approval by an authorised curator, who is personally making creative decisions and engaging their free speech interest.\n\nIMO, it will depend on the platform. Platforms with specific focus that restrict content to  a specific form/subject matter will probably be publishers, as they're exercising real editorial discretion, rejecting by default anything that doesn't match their fairly narrow speciality, akin to say... a special interest newspaper or magazine. But the general discussion platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Discord, etc. may well find themselves classified as distributors, and thus potentially subject to common carrier regulation.\n\n(Really interesting question is how this would apply to user moderation though, like group admins on Facebook, or Reddit/Discord moderators.

China‚Äôs Rush to Dominate A.I. Comes With a Twist: It Depends on U.S. Technology | Chinese firms aim to catch up by turning to open-source A.I. models from the U.S.,22,1awz3fk,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/technology/china-united-states-artificial-intelligence.html,,"['gonna quote a few paragraphs here, not in the order they appear in.\n\n>‚ÄúWhen Chinese companies are leveraging American open-source technologies to play catch-up, the questions become very complicated ‚Äî wrapped up in issues of national security and geopolitics,‚Äù said Oren Etzioni, a University of Washington professor who specializes in A.I. and the founder of TrueMedia.org, a nonprofit working to identify disinformation online in political campaigns.\n\nah yeah that makes sense, china is always playing catch up. you right\n\n>A.I. has long been a priority in China. After the A.I. tool AlphaGo defeated two top players of the board game Go in 2016 and 2017, Chinese policymakers set out an ambitious plan to lead the world in technology by 2030. The government pledged billions to researchers and companies focused on A.I.  \n>  \n>Wang Changhu, the former head of ByteDance‚Äôs A.I. lab, founded a company called AIsphere in Beijing last year to spearhead what he saw as the next major frontier in the technology: video generation. In November, the start-up released PixVerse, an A.I.-powered generator that can create video from a text description.\n\n... wait i thought they were playing catch up\n\n>Tech investors in China have also pushed for quick turnarounds from A.I., which has meant money has flowed to easy-to-execute applications instead of more ambitious goals focused on fundamental research, said Yiran Chen, a John Cocke Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University. As much as 50 percent of China‚Äôs A.I. investment has gone into computer vision technology, which is required for surveillance, instead of building foundation models for generative A.I., he said.\n\nwait holup. [hey copilot](https://sl.bing.net/iimao8ohjUq), is this misrepresenting the facts?\n\n>me:  \n  \n>  \n>doesnt generative ai technology rely on computer vision technology? maybe not for text generation, but for image and video generation and recognition?  \n  \n>  \n>copilot:  \n  \n>  \n>Generative AI and computer vision are indeed related, but they serve different purposes and operate in distinct ways:  \n  \n>  \n>\\- Generative AI:  \n  \n>  \n>\\- Definition: Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that produces new, unique content such as text, images, audio, video, or code.-   \n  \n>  \n>Functionality: Unlike traditional AI models that recognize patterns or classify data, generative AI aims to create new data with similar characteristics based on existing data patterns.  \n  \n>  \n>\\- Examples: Generative AI models include chatbots like ChatGPT and Bing Chat, GitHub Copilot (which generates code), and DALL-E (which creates images from text prompts).  \n  \n>  \n>\\- Process: Users input prompts or instructions, and the model generates responses or content based on the training data.  \n  \n>  \n>\\- Role in Computer Vision: Generative AI enhances computer vision by enabling semantic understanding of visual content. It allows for more accurate and robust visual analysis by leveraging a wider range of data.-   \n  \n>  \n>Computer Vision:  \n  \n>  \n>\\- Definition: Computer vision empowers machines to interpret and understand visual information, similar to how humans do.  \n  \n>  \n>\\- Functionality: It enables computers to analyze and process visual data, detect objects, recognize patterns, and make predictions.  \n  \n>  \n>\\- Applications: Computer vision is used in image recognition, video analysis, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and more.  \n  \n>  \n>\\- Real-Time Insights: Unlike generative AI, computer vision provides real-time insights into operations by interpreting visual data as it happens.In summary, while generative AI can create text or images based on past data, computer vision focuses on understanding and analyzing visual information in real time. The synergy between these two fields contributes to advancements in both content generation and visual analysis.  \n  \n>  \n>me:  \n  \n>  \n>right so basically **without computer vision technology, generative ai that isnt text based would not exist. correct?**  \n  \n>  \n>copilot:  \n  \n>  \n>**Indeed, you\'re correct!** Generative AI models that create content beyond text often rely on computer vision technology. Without computer vision, the capabilities of generative AI would be limited to text-based outputs. Computer vision plays a crucial role in enabling machines to understand and interpret visual data, which in turn enhances generative AI by allowing it to generate images, videos, and other non-textual content. Together, these fields contribute to exciting advancements in both content creation and visual analysis. üåüü§ñüëÄ\n\nanyway, moving on...\n\n>Now Baidu, Alibaba, the dairy company Mengniu and the tutoring firm TAL Education have all jumped into the generative A.I. race in China, leading Chinese media to coin the phrase ‚Äúthe battle of 100 models‚Äù to describe the frenzy.\n\nlol what why is there a dairy company involved. is it because all of this shit is gonna age like milk? insert {sheogorath\\_cheese\\_for\\_everyone.gif}\n\n>Some have criticized the free-for-all as publicity stunts that add unnecessary competition. In a panel discussion last year, Robin Li, Baidu‚Äôs chief executive, described having hundreds of basic A.I. models as a waste.\n\nwait is this about china or the us? i cant keep up theres way too many ""models"" that do the literal exact same thing but slightly different. all of which is mostly not all that useful. fun? yeah. neat? kinda. does it actual produce much of anything ""valuable""? no comment.\n\n>‚ÄúMore resources should be allocated to applications in various industries, especially considering the limitations on our computing power,‚Äù he said.\n\nagreed. automating agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation should be the focus. good thing thats what everyone is doing!\n\nright? insert {anakin\\_padme\\_meme.jpeg}', 'This is typical China behavior. copycatting']"

New chip opens door to AI computing at light speed,16,1asnwxm,https://phys.org/news/2024-02-chip-door-ai.html,,"[""Engineers from the University of Pennsylvania have created a groundbreaking chip that uses light instead of electricity to conduct complex calculations crucial for AI training. This silicon-photonic (SiPh) chip, leveraging light‚Äîthe fastest medium for communication‚Äîcould significantly boost computer processing speeds and reduce energy usage. The innovation stems from combining Nader Engheta's research in nanoscale material manipulation with the SiPh platform, utilizing silicon's abundance and affordability. This approach to vector-matrix multiplication, essential for neural networks and AI, promises enhanced speed and efficiency by controlling light's propagation through precise silicon thickness variations. Ready for commercial use, this technology could revolutionize graphics processing units (GPUs) and offer unparalleled privacy benefits by eliminating the need to store sensitive data in working memory, thus preventing hacks. The team's findings, including contributions from Firooz Aflatouni and other Penn Engineering members, are detailed in Nature Photonics, marking a potential paradigm shift in computing towards faster, more secure AI development.\n\nWhen will there be a consumer model???""]"

Researchers add a ‚Äòtwist‚Äô to classical material design. They‚Äôve discovered that crystals can twist when they are sandwiched between two substrates ‚Äì a critical step toward exploring new material properties for electronics and other applications.,334,1aeysbg,https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2024-01-24-researchers-add-twist-classical-material-design,,"['Hey, people smarter and better informed than me. How big is this as news? It sounds pretty big', '[Nothing new](https://y.yarn.co/bce6e422-8d82-482d-945a-6eca8d4cc3d2_text.gif)', 'Researchers add a ‚Äòtwist‚Äô to classical material design\n\nThey‚Äôve discovered that crystals can twist when they are sandwiched between two substrates ‚Äì a critical step toward exploring new material properties for electronics and other applications.\n\nResearchers with the Department of Energy‚Äôs\xa0SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University and the DOE\'s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) grew a twisted multilayer crystal structure for the first time and measured the structure‚Äôs key properties. The twisted structure could help researchers develop next-generation materials for solar cells, quantum computers, lasers and other devices.\n\n‚ÄúThis structure is something that we have not seen before ‚Äì it was a huge surprise to me,‚Äù said Yi Cui, a professor at Stanford and SLAC and paper co-author. ‚ÄúA new quantum electronic property could appear within this three-layer twisted structure in future experiments.‚Äù\n\nAdding layers, with a twist\n\nThe crystals the team designed extended the concept of epitaxy, a phenomenon that occurs when one type of crystal material grows on top of another material in an ordered way ‚Äì kind of like growing a neat lawn on top of soil, but at the atomic level. Understanding epitaxial growth has been critical to the development of many industries for more than 50 years, particularly the semiconductor industry. Indeed, epitaxy is part of many of the electronic devices that we use today, from cell phones to computers to solar panels, allowing electricity to flow, and not flow, through them.\n\nTo date, epitaxy research has focused on growing one layer of material onto another, and the two materials have the same crystal orientation at the interface. This approach has been successful for decades in many applications, such as\xa0transistors,\xa0light-emitting diodes, lasers and quantum devices. But to find new materials that perform even better for more demanding needs, like quantum computing, researchers are searching for other epitaxial designs ‚Äì ones that might be more complex, yet better performing, hence the ""twisted epitaxy"" concept demonstrated in this study.\n\nÔøºThe MoS2 layers and gold nanodiscs together heated up to 500 degrees Celsius. The three marked regions ‚Äì I, II, and III ‚Äì indicate the various layers of the sample. Region I shows gold on the bottom MoS2 layer; II shows Au below the top MoS2 layer; and III shows the gold between the top and bottom MoS2 layers. The gold nanodiscs are the darker regions in the region III.\xa0 (Yi Cui/Stanford University)\n\nIn their experiment, detailed this month in\xa0Science, researchers added a layer of gold between two sheets of a traditional semiconducting material, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Because the top and bottom sheets were oriented differently, the gold atoms could not align with both simultaneously, which allowed the Au structure to twist, said Yi Cui, Professor Cui\'s graduate student in materials science and engineering at Stanford and co-author of the paper.\n\n‚ÄúWith only a bottom MoS2\xa0layer, the gold is happy to align with it, so no twist happens,‚Äù said Cui, the graduate student. ‚ÄúBut with two twisted MoS2\xa0sheets, the gold isn‚Äôt sure to align with the top or bottom layer. We managed to help the gold solve its confusion and discovered a relationship between the orientation of Au and the twist angle of bilayer MoS2.‚Äù\n\nZapping gold nanodiscs\n\nTo study the gold layer in detail, the researcher team from the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences (SIMES) and LBNL heated a sample of the whole structure to 500 degrees Celsius. Then they sent a stream of electrons through the sample using a technique called transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which revealed the morphology, orientation and strain of the gold nanodiscs after annealing at the different temperatures. Measuring these properties of the gold nanodiscs was a necessary first step toward understanding how the new structure could be designed for real world applications in the future.\n\nÔøºThe diffraction pattern of region III, where diffraction spots from bottom MoS2, top MoS2 and Au are marked in blue, green and orange, respectively. The Au spots are not on the yellow lines, which note the ideal alignment, indicating the Au layer is twisted.\xa0 (Yi Cui/Stanford University)\n\n‚ÄúWithout this study, we would not know if twisting an epitaxial layer of\xa0metal\xa0on top of a\xa0semiconductor\xa0was even possible,‚Äù said Cui, the graduate student. ‚ÄúMeasuring the complete three-layer structure with electron microscopy confirmed that it was not only possible, but also that the new structure could be controlled in exciting ways.‚Äù\n\nNext, researchers want to further study the optical properties of the gold\xa0nanodiscs using TEM\xa0and learn if their design\xa0alters physical properties like band structure of Au. They also want to extend this concept to try to build three-layer structures with other semiconductor materials and other metals.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre beginning to explore whether only this combination of materials allows this or if it happens more broadly,‚Äù said Bob Sinclair, the Charles M. Pigott Professor in Stanford‚Äôs school of Materials Science and Engineering and paper co-author. ‚ÄúThis discovery is opening a whole new series of experiments that we can try. We could be on our way to finding brand new material properties that we could exploit.‚Äù\n\nFunding for this study came from the DOE Office of Science‚Äôs Basic Energy Sciences.\n\nCitation: Cui et al.,\xa0Science, 12 January 2024 (10.1126/science.adk5947)\n\nSLAC is a vibrant multiprogram laboratory that explores how the universe works at the biggest, smallest and fastest scales and invents powerful tools used by scientists around the globe.

The Oxford dropout worked as a negotiator for the United Nations and the Dutch government early in his career, but then pivoted to AI and founded DeepMind in 2010 alongside Demis Hassabis and Shane Legg.\n\nThe machine learning lab grew like a weed under Suleyman, with the backing of Peter Thiel‚Äôs Founders‚Äô Fund, before selling to\xa0Google\xa0parent company Alphabet for ¬£400 million in 2014. Suleyman then took on several roles at\xa0DeepMind\xa0before stepping down five years later.\n\nNow, the veteran AI founder is working on a new company called Inflection AI, which offers personalized AI assistants. And while Suleyman remains an avid supporter of AI, he expressed concerns about the industry‚Äôs possible negative effects‚Äîin particular on workers.\xa0\n\n‚ÄúIn the long term‚Ä¶we have to think very hard about how we integrate these tools, because left completely to the market and to their own devices, these are fundamentally labor replacing tools,‚Äù Suleyman\xa0told\xa0CNBC\xa0on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum‚Äôs annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nAI tools do two main things fundamentally differently, the DeepMind co-founder said. First, they make existing operations more efficient, which can lead to huge savings for businesses, but often by replacing the humans who did those jobs. Second, they allow for entirely new operations and processes to be created‚Äîa process that can lead to job creation. These two forces will both hit the labor market by storm in coming years, leaving a serious, but unpredictable impact.\xa0\n\nWhile Suleyman expects AI to ‚Äúaugment us and make us smarter and more productive for the next couple decades,‚Äù over the long term, its impact is still ‚Äúan open question.‚Äù\n\nExperts have been\xa0debating\xa0whether AI will replace human workers for over a decade. Some researchers argue that AI will lead to a wave of\xa0unemployment\xa0and economic disruption as it takes jobs worldwide, but others believe that the technology will create new job opportunities and spur economic growth by boosting worker productivity.\n\nThere‚Äôs been a steady stream of academic papers on the topic. A 2013\xa0study\xa0by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, for example, estimated that 47% of US jobs are at risk of being automated amid the AI boom by the mid-2030s. And a July\xa0McKinsey\xa0study\xa0found that nearly 12 million Americans will need to switch jobs by 2030 as AI takes over their roles.\n\nOn the other hand, some researchers have found that AI could boost economic growth and offer new opportunities for workers. A 2022 United Nations‚Äô International Labor Organization (ILO)\xa0study\xa0found that most AI systems will complement workers, rather than replacing them.\n\nStill, Suleyman isn‚Äôt the only big name in the AI industry to warn about the scary implications of AI for the labor market.\xa0\n\nIn a Jan. 10\xa0Wired\xa0article, MIT professor Daron Acemoglu predicted that AI would disappoint everyone in 2024, proving itself merely a form of ‚Äúso-so automation‚Äù that will take jobs from workers but fail to deliver the expected monumental improvements to productivity.\xa0\n\nResearchers have yet to solve the problem of hallucinations‚Äîwhere generative AI systems exaggerate or fabricate facts‚Äîand that could lead to a whole host of issues in coming years, the noted economist argued, adding that there‚Äôs ‚Äúno quick fix‚Äù to the problem.\n\n‚ÄúGenerative AI is an impressive technology, and it provides tremendous opportunities for improving productivity in a number of tasks. But because the hype has gone so far ahead of reality, the setbacks of the technology in 2024 will be more memorable,‚Äù Acemoglu wrote.\n\nFor Suleyman, unlike Acemoglu, it‚Äôs not that hype surrounding AI isn‚Äôt real, it‚Äôs definitely a ‚Äútruly transformational technology.‚Äù\xa0\n\n‚ÄúEverything that is of value in our world has been created by our intelligence, our ability to reason over information and make predictions. These tools do exactly that, so it‚Äôs going to be very fundamental,‚Äù he explained Wednesday.\n\nSuleyman instead fears that AI will be so good at replicating humans that it will eventually displace workers, and without regulation, that could lead to serious economic consequences.\n\nThat being said, like Acemoglu, Suleyman argued that AI‚Äôs proponents might be getting ahead of themselves with their optimistic near-term outlooks for rising productivity. The true impact of AI, from its ability to birth revolutionary technologies to its potential to stoke epic job losses, likely won‚Äôt hit for years.\n\n‚ÄúAI is truly one of the most incredible technologies of our lifetimes, but at the same time, it feels like expectations about its delivery are higher than they‚Äôve ever been and maybe we have hit a kind of peak hype for this moment,‚Äù he explained.\n\nSubscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business.\xa0Sign up\xa0for free."", 'I thought that was the idea.

Passengers can ask questions or steer the narrative, making each journey a unique experience. Imagine being stuck in traffic and having the ability to delve into the world of Velociraptors or Triceratops with just a voice command.\n\n**Technology and Design**\n\nIntegrating ChatGPT into the car\'s infotainment system was no small feat. The developers had to ensure the AI was responsive, intuitive, and, most importantly, safe for use while driving. The system is voice-activated and hands-free, allowing drivers to stay focused on the road while passengers embark on prehistoric adventures.\n\nThe design of the Prehistoric Explorer also complements its unique feature. The interior has subtle dinosaur-themed elements, and the exterior boasts a sleek, futuristic design, paying homage to the blend of the ancient and the modern.\n\n**Educational and Fun**\n\nApart from being a source of entertainment, the Prehistoric Explorer serves an educational purpose. It\'s an engaging way for children and adults alike to learn about these magnificent creatures that once roamed the Earth. The accuracy and depth of information provided by ChatGPT make each story not just fun, but also informative.\n\n**Future Implications**\n\nThis innovation marks a significant step in the evolution of in-car entertainment systems. It demonstrates the potential of AI in enhancing our everyday experiences and opens up new possibilities for educational and interactive features in vehicles.\n\nIn conclusion, the Prehistoric Explorer is not just a car; it\'s a mobile gateway to the ancient world, powered by the latest in AI technology. It\'s an example of how creative integration of technology can transform mundane experiences into extraordinary adventures. As we move further into an era where technology melds seamlessly with every aspect of our lives, the Prehistoric Explorer stands as a testament to the endless possibilities that await.\n\n\n\n/s', ""This is cool.

Rate limits- I guess that would help in the scenario that they did this all from 1 computer, on 1 IP address, on 1 day, all at once. In reality they could change the IP after every compromise easily, have multiple virtual machines to work on at once, and work over multiple days. Rate limits would stop none of this. \n\n3. Compromised Credential Change- again, not really on 23&Me. If 23&Me utilizes a service that compares their user account emails/usernames to known breaches, they can request users change their password, but users don‚Äôt always. And not all sites do this, many actually do not. I have plenty of large banking/service sites using previously compromised credentials that have never made an effort to tell me that, I found it on my own and changed it. It is not their responsibility. \n\nSo again, if somebody can explain how exactly it is 23&Me‚Äôs fault that a handful of their users were victims of a 3rd party breach credential stuffing attack, I‚Äôd love to hear it. Reiterating that 2factor isn‚Äôt 23‚Äôs responsibility, checking for their users credentials in breaches isn‚Äôt their responsibility, and rate limits wouldn‚Äôt have helped in real life.', ""This should be a good case to watch and much of what has been said I agree with.   The provider didn't have a cyber incident leading to data loss. People who used the providers services had poor password control. Add to that an even larger group of people making the decision to share their data with strangers based on their linkage via DNA or geography. Those choices led to a situation where a small group of people had a bunch of their PII exposed because they basically gave away their own credentials and a much bigger group had a much smaller amount of PII exposed because the malicious actors used the access to look at what those accounts legitimately had access to. \n\nI think there could be some arguments around logging failed attempts. That said when bad guys use this tactic they normally go very very slowly using many many IP's so identifying a pattern in what I'm sure is a lot of legit bad password attempts could be very difficult. (Commonly referred to as signal to noise ratio). If there is evidence of lots of failed attempts from a small number of IP's Over a short period then maybe you make a case but short of something like that this doesn't really feel like their fault."", ""This reminds me when everyone was saying that their nests were getting hacked but it was just them using password123 with no 2 Factor.\n\nBut as a company 23and Me could have at least been a bit sympathetic about it and not so arrogant and shitty.

As the network core gets upgraded to support what is called\xa05G Standalone, 5G networks will improve.\n\nGartner analyst Bill Menezes told us at the time: ""As the carriers continue updating their networks for 5G Standalone technology, users will increasingly experience the promised improvements in speed and reliability."" He added that it takes about three to five years to fully roll out a new mobile generation.\n\n5G is, at least, delivering higher speeds, depending on location. Although the average speeds users in the UK are likely to see are lower than what it is theoretically capable of ‚Äì somewhere between 75 Mbps and 240 Mbps by some estimates ‚Äì this is multiple times faster than 4G.\n\nMeanwhile, the industry has not stood still, and 3GPP Release 18 marks the start of 5G-Advanced, which is expected to be frozen early in 2024 and finalized in the summer. This is forecast to bring a number of evolutionary improvements as well as new features, that may address the limitations of the initial 5G rollouts.\n\n5G-Advanced introduces support for non-terrestrial networks (such as satellite connections) increasing coverage in remote and rural areas, and is claimed to offer better uplink speeds.\n\nWhile mobile broadband and Internet of Things (IoT) were held up as 5G use cases, 5G-Advanced promises to hike mobile broadband performance, support for new applications, and boost intelligent network automation, at least according to a\xa0whitepaper\xa0commissioned by telecoms outfit Ericsson.\n\nExtra performance comes from MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) signal capacity being boosted in both uplink and downlink with support for enhanced demodulation reference symbols.', 'I just once want to see 5G that isn‚Äôt some 5GE bs', ""Gotta get that next number out before your competition (even though the technology is poorly implemented for most people, they've bought most of their competition, and 6G is bound to be more gimmicky than 5G)"", 'Any ideas on what the new world order is going to infect us with using 6G? /s', 'I live in a Bulgarian seaside village and get 970 Mbps on my iPhone...while sitting in my park.\n\nTruly astonishing.', 'I aint even got lte most of the time', 'can‚Äôt wait to find 5G unbearably slow like I presently do 4G', 'Huawei 6G will gain their dominance like their 5G.', 'Ugh!

They offer better color performance and can work effectively in bright outdoor environments. Micro-OLEDs are self-emissive, offering true blacks and high brightness, while micro-LEDs promise even greater brightness and longevity.\n\n5. **Potential and Challenges:** The technology\'s high pixel density allows for smaller, lighter headsets. Companies like Mojo Vision are developing extremely high-resolution micro-LED displays. However, there are challenges like manufacturing costs and the risk of defects like dead pixels.\n\n6. **Future of AR Headsets:** Despite the high production costs, the benefits of micro-OLED and micro-LED technology could significantly enhance AR experiences. They may lead to the development of lighter, more discreet AR glasses that resemble conventional eyewear.\n\n7. **Impact on Various Fields:** The technology is already being used in specialized applications like surgery and military equipment. It has the potential to make AR more accessible and attractive to consumers, leading to its widespread adoption.\n\nIn summary, the article highlights the exciting potential of tiny LED and OLED technology in transforming AR and VR, overcoming the limitations of previous attempts like Google Glass, and paving the way for more practical and appealing AR devices.', 'I didn‚Äôt click.

It just got a lot weaker\n\nNovel Terrapin attack uses prefix truncation to downgrade the security of SSH channels.\n\nby\xa0Dan Goodin\xa0-\xa0Dec 19, 2023 12:35pm EST\n\nÔøºTerrapin is coming for your data. Aurich Lawson | Getty Images\n\nSometime around the start of 1995, an unknown person planted a password sniffer on the network backbone of Finland‚Äôs Helsinki University of Technology (now known as Aalto University). Once in place, this piece of dedicated hardware surreptitiously inhaled thousands of user names and passwords before it was finally discovered. Some of the credentials belonged to employees of a company run by Tatu Yl√∂nen, who was also a database researcher at the university.\n\nThe event proved to be seminal, not just for Yl√∂nen\'s company but for the entire world. Until that point, people like Yl√∂nen connected to networks using tools which implemented protocols such as Telnet, rlogin, rcp, and rsh. All of these transmitted passwords (and all other data) as plaintext, providing an endless stream of valuable information to sniffers. Yl√∂nen, who at the time knew little about implementing strong cryptography in code, set out to develop the\xa0Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)\xa0in early 1995, about three months after the discovery of the password sniffer.\n\nAs one of the first network tools to route traffic through an impregnable tunnel fortified with a still-esoteric feature known as ""public key encryption,"" SSH quickly caught on around the world. Besides its unprecedented security guarantees, SSH was easy to install on a wide array of operating systems, including the myriad ones that powered the devices administrators used‚Äîand the servers those devices connected to remotely. SSH also supported\xa0X11 forwarding, which allowed users to run graphical applications on a remote server.\n\nYl√∂nen submitted SSH to the Internet Engineering Taskforce in 1996, and it quickly became an almost ubiquitous tool for remotely connecting computers. Today, it‚Äôs hard to overstate the importance of the protocol, which underpins the security of apps used inside millions of organizations, including cloud environments crucial to Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other large companies.\n\n‚ÄúPassword sniffing attacks were very common at that time, with new incidents reported almost weekly, and arguably it was the biggest security problem on the Internet at the time,‚Äù Yl√∂nen wrote in an online interview. ‚ÄúI did intend SSH to become as widely used as possible. It was critically needed for securing networks and computing systems, and it for the most part solved the password sniffing problem.‚Äù\n\nNow, nearly 30 years later, researchers have devised an attack with the potential to undermine, if not cripple, cryptographic SSH protections that the networking world takes for granted.\n\nMeet Terrapin\n\nNamed Terrapin, the new hack works only when an attacker has an active adversary-in-the middle position on the connection between the admins and the network they remotely connect to. Also known as a man-in-the-middle or MitM attack, this occurs when an attacker secretly positioned between two parties intercepts communications and assumes the identity of both the recipient and the sender. This provides the ability to both intercept and to alter communications. While this position can be difficult for an attacker to achieve, it‚Äôs one of the scenarios from which SSH was thought to have immunity.\n\nFor Terrapin to be viable, the connection it interferes with also must be secured by either ""ChaCha20-Poly1305"" or ""CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC,"" both of which are cipher modes added to the SSH protocol (in 2013 and 2012, respectively). A scan performed by the researchers found that 77 percent of SSH servers exposed to the Internet support at least one of the vulnerable encryption modes, while 57 percent of them list a vulnerable encryption mode as the preferred choice.\n\nAt its core, Terrapin works by altering or corrupting information transmitted in the SSH data stream during the handshake‚Äîthe earliest stage of a connection, when the two parties negotiate the encryption parameters they will use to establish a secure connection. The attack targets the BPP, short for\xa0Binary Packet Protocol, which is designed to ensure that adversaries with an active position can\'t add or drop messages exchanged during the handshake. Terrapin relies on prefix truncation, a class of attack that removes specific messages at the very beginning of a data stream.', 'Great jobs by the researchers finding this. Add ChaCha20-Poly1305 and CBC-EtM to the growing list of deprecated encryption algorithms, I guess.', 'That‚Äôs not a hole in SSH, they proved the cipher.\n\n¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø shit happens.', 'This is CVE-2023-48795 for the people who don‚Äôt like clickbait.', 'What.
