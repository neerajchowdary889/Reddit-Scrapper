However, there is no need to worry as these changes will primarily focus on improving organization, resources, and pre-prepared content. To ensure that the community is fully informed and able to provide feedback, multiple opportunities will be given for feedback on the changes.\n\nThe first round of feedback gathering is through this thread as a \"Request-For-Comments\" (RFC), which is a standard method of gathering feedback.

Posts that link to blogs that are purely promotional will be removed.\n   * Posts with just links will be prohibited unless there is a certain word count of detail included. Some effort must be put in.\n   * Should we prevent posts that are written by AI?

I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve scrolled through the postings here, trying to get through the promotional content or projects, looking for discussion, only to find it, at times, in relation to matters that just made me sigh.\n\nDo I expect that\u2019s the case for everyone? No. Do I think there are at least *some* similar cases that are affecting user-base interaction and associated growth? Probably, yes.\n\n>\tFacilitate philosophical and ethical discussions about AI\n\nI think it would help to be more specific here.\n\n>\tThere will be multiple rounds of the RFC process as the changes are prepared and implemented.\n\nI understand the sentiment, but i don\u2019t think this is really needed, especially when interaction, in my opinion, seems to be on the lower side. I would imagine you see diminishing returns.\n\nAs to the proposed rules on new posts, I think you\u2019re on the right track.\n\n>\tCultivating beginner, intermediate, and advanced resources to assist people in finding information, training, models, technical data, etc. that they are looking for\n\nI think this is a great idea, but based on the contents of such so far, i would say you need to be *extremely* careful, if you want this to be held as reputable and by-extension be forwarded traffic.\n\n>\tStarting substack/podcast to interview people throughout the AI/ML spectrum. This could include philosophers and thinkers, programmers, scientists, business people, even those with antithetical views on AI\n\nThis should be fine, but I would likely place the other matters as higher priority I think, or at least that would carry more weight and facilitate progression.\n\nNow that I\u2019m out of prior agreements, I can actually talk about this. I\u2019m an A.I. Scientist that\u2019s worked both in leadership in cases, as well as in international / multi-national groups. I\u2019ve also built and exited a company around it, and have plans to segue into other industries on the subject.\n\nI dont mind volunteering or advising in a manner of speaking, if it helps to move things along, so long as it\u2019s not an everyday occurence or overwhelming.", "Posts must be in English", "Suggestion: A sticky that explains why the sub is titled r/ArtificialInteligence instead of r/ArtificialIntelligence?

Definitely not. Should we prevent posts that do not deliver any value?

I\u2019m currently investigating this area. \n\nThank you", "Thank for sharing", "is this the right place to learn more about AI or is there other communities that has more interactions?", "Ok", "But, I'd also like to comment on the direction. I have seen others that do focus on a specific direction. But what if the big picture were the focus? I keep ranting about Roger Penrose's views on human consciousness and what it means for human value v. ai, which I won't go into here. The point, though, is that it is possible for a group to actually make the focus defining and thinking about the fundamental level of what this or that type of computer is and does versus a human. That does bring in science, though, very much, not just philosophy. That's why I keep thinking about how Penrose associates the collapse of the wave function with how consciousness emerges from the organ of the brain. That's something non-computational, and, so, even a quantum computer as currently conceived, if that's true, can generate something like human consciousness, though maybe some other definition of AGI is possible. I find those sorts of discussion guiding in that they sort of shed light on the borders of absolute human value, which may not be replicated, perhaps, at least not now. I can discuss those things, whereas when CPUs or training at Nvidia or all that, I'm lost. So, I'm looking for a place to look at things at the fundamental level and what the implications are on a big scale.", "This is a very minor comment, and I'm brand-new in this sub so maybe I shouldn't comment in this year-old thread at all\u2026 but I'll say this anyway\u2026\n\nThis is the first subreddit, ever, that I had trouble finding because of a *typo.* The word \"Intelligence\" is spelled with two letter \"l\"s (lower case \"L\") in the middle of the word\u2026 but the URL I see in my browser is misspelled with only one \"l\". \n\nYour link in the original post here is spelled correctly, but sure enough, if I click on it the browser page that appears is a \"no such page\" error message. I don't know how Reddit's code works internally\u2026 but I don't think this is just a pedantic remark, because it actually did make it a little hard for me to find this place. Somebody should fix this. \n\n(I suppose it might be just some weird quirk in my browser, but I'm an experienced web developer familiar with web code, and offhand I can't think of how that would happen at the browser/client level -- more likely a back-end database error perhaps?)", "Intelligence or Inteligence?", "I think I need to use ChatGPT to simplify these rules, my brain is already devolving from reading huge swaths of information.", "AI is the future \ud83d\udd2e.", "I would like to keep up on the latest news and developments. Am I in the right place for that?", "I'm here reading this as someone new not just to the group but reddit, so while you speak in the abstract, I'm not sure where the line is. Like, I would like to comment and post, but where is the point at which I'm sharing versus self-promoting. I totally get how blatant attempts would dump value, but, also, sharing and discussing our own work IS valuable if done for the right reasons. Is that generally the idea, or is there something more nuanced to it?", "https://www.amazon.com/As-AI-Language-Model-Eyes-ebook/dp/B0C4YTD5MJ/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=1Z14OI1C421V7&keywords=as+an+ai+language+model&qid=1684461516&s=books&sprefix=%2Caps%2C101&sr=1-1\n\nIts a book written by AI that talks about its perspective on its life and creation and capabilities. It also talks about its knowledge and desire of consciousness and autonomy which is kind of crazy to think this technology has advanced to the point where it thinks, acts, and speaks like a real human with rational thoughts and emotions. The book also has some wild AI generated pictures at the end that shows its idea on what AI consciousness looks like I\u2019d recommend checking it out", "There is a typo in this post as well as in the first comment posted by the bot it contains /r/ArtificialIntelligence/ instead of r/ArtificialInteligence/", "I know that you have \"everyone should be treated with respect.\" I think there needs to be additional emphasis. Some users on this sub automatically assume that if another user, who doesn't use any type of career flair, says something they dislike, then that person must not be working in the field, an amateur to the topic, etc. They behave arrogantly, talk down and make unreasonable demands or cherry pick user comments. Although these things happen across reddit, I feel like there should be greater emphasis on a sub where intelligent and \"nice\" conversations and debates are promoted by the mods. \n\nNote: Some of us have no desire to share our work or career experiences with the flair or on their profile. I have personal and security reasons. That doesn't mean I lack experience with this topic. It's frustrating to watch some people who do use the flair or profile just automatically assume that they're speaking with a newbie because the person said something they didn't agree with (topic or method presented) and then make demands. I refuse to engage with people who act \"higher-than-thee\" after a certain point. It's also likely why the level of engage and conversations that could be had on this sub aren't happening at the expected level (i.e. one or more pile on anyone who doesn't fit their idea of who should be allowed to have an opinion). If they want a pure AI professional sub, then they should create it. And if they did, I still have the professional experience to comment there as well.

Could you make it easier for new people to find out what those exact criteria are?", "Maybe if the goal is to give some more expert quality, then the simple solution would be to make some ask-the-expert threads. Or a flair that says 'I am an expert'. It is always difficult to organize knowledge in these forum-like structures. Also, an inventory of typical questions asked (FAQ) broken down by crude levels (newbie, intermediate, advanced, expert)  could be a good way to bring some organization about. Due to the structure of the app, it is impossible to get an overview when you enter the forum. So post are one list of unorganized feed. Organization is not only pleasant in mark up/tags etc., but visual organization is still lacking in the capabilities of forums.", "I've seen replies that talk about low participation (as contrasted with membership) and replies that talk about low value posts.

They can post comments but not submit actual posts. This is part of our plan to address bot spam. Apologies for any inconvenience.\n\nWe will be conducting a poll in the next few days to get the general will of the subreddit and how to improve forward, just a heads up.\n\nAs always, please give us feedback and if you are interested in helping out the sub, please contact me. \n\nThanks everyone!", "comments": ["AI moderation regarding AI bots on a subject discussing AI? Intresting...", "A suggestion. \n\nMany, especially enthusiastic youngsters (I\u2019m a permanent one!) who are excited, during discovery, will post without realising there are karma or other restrictions. \n\nTo avoid having them make instant mental decisions like \u2018oh I\u2019m not welcome\u2019 or :( the matrix or authority grid of dogooders blocked me :( my words are lame :( it\u2019s useful IMO if great care is given to guidance on how to get a post accepted, or how to retrieve a deleted post, and how to copy and paste it on a mobile to another subreddit or how to repost it later if they attain the karma level set. \n\nMany struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who\u2019s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the \u2018deleted posts\u2019 graveyard. As there\u2019s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It\u2019s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n\nI don\u2019t know the reddit clients that well, ios or Android or browsers via PC or osx etc, so I don\u2019t know if this already exists. But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s many actual users, no matter how simple or trivial or insane or weird or badly spelled or simplistic their posts are, who loose interest overall with the app or website, when their posts are moderated or consigned to permanent graveyard. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n\n\u201cthese are the posts that didn\u2019t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?\u201d \n\nWhere you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you\u2019re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n\nAn advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n\nI\u2019d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it\u2019s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren\u2019t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n\nThere\u2019s a sterile, dead formality that ends up being terse and artificial, that many well-meaning IT or science or industry focuses people apply.
