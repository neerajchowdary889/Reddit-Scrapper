After that he left to set up on his own with the studio V1 Interactive (which made the shooter Disintegration), before joining EA in 2021 and founding Ridgeline Games, a Seattle-based developer that was working on a new Battlefield game with more of a story focus.\n\nI say ""was"" because unfortunately Ridgeline has become one of the latest victims in a brutal period of game and tech layoffs. At the end of February EA announced that it would be closing the studio, and laying off all of its staff. Around the same time, Lehto announced he would be leaving the publisher. And he\'s not a happy camper.\n\n""Gut punched to see EA lay off my team,"" said Lehto on X. ""So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise.""\n\nLehto wants to make one thing clear: ""Yes, I left EA on my own accord. This was a very tough decision for me to make."" He thanks the Battlefield community, and wishes the remaining teams at EA all the best for the future, then turns his guns on the publisher.\n\n""Not been saying much here since I don’t have anything positive to say about EA [and] my recent departure,"" says Lehto. ""And how so many, including my team, are suffering due to the industry sweeping layoffs."" Lehto later posted on LinkedIn saying he\'s ""incredibly upset and very sad"" about the layoffs and Ridgeline ""are very talented people whose lives are being upended needlessly.""\n\nThe single-player campaign in the works at Ridgeline was a co-development with DICE, which Lehto had previously said would ""engage players in new ways."" It was apparently a standalone project, though what if anything will happen to it now is unknown. \n\nLehto\'s enough of an industry veteran not to say what he really thinks: but you can certainly tell what he really thinks, and clearly this one cuts deep. Lehto ended his post by announcing he\'s going to take a break from the industry, and think about whether he even wants to return.

The final big boss is supposed to be super tough and scary, but ended up killing him without even needing to reload. \n\nI walked around for a few minutes waiting for a phase 2 and had to look up videos because i couldn't believe the fight would be that quick. Kinda a letdown just because the gun was incredibly overpowered."", 'Skar in the Lion King', ""Marlowe and Talbot in Uncharted 3. \n\nReally intriguing right from the start as they were introduced as being part of some old world secret society with deeply rooted plans for taking control of the world. Only to be replaced at the halfway point by a different villain for a few chapters and then reappear towards the end with no explanation as to who they really were, how they did the things they did, or what their society was. \n\nIf there was ever a game I would want a remake of it's that one. Add the extra stuff that got cut for time and go with the original version of the story before the re-writes."", 'Vas from far cry 3, made the first half of the game fantastic, really felt like a true villain just for him not to be the main antagonist', 'Lambent Brumak from Gears of War 2. \n\nJust sitting in a helicopter holding down the trigger for hammer of dawn', 'Infinite from sonic forces, started off with such promise but then was rly underused and not developed.

Although at his worst he took several playable characters with him.', 'Oh, Final Fantasy Tactics. \n\nIt’s a game with one of the franchise’s absolute best villains (Wiegraf), who is a wonderful recurring villain in thematic and mechanical ways. It features an upstart hero that is broken by loss and who plunged into becoming a ruthless, scheming monster that could very well have been the end boss; and because he’s not, the bad guy wins in FFT. It features a string of betrayals that feel like they have stakes, either for the protagonist or those around him.\n\nAnd yet… the end boss is *boring*. If you’re going to have a bunch of demons orchestrate murder on a continental scale to essentially serve as a blood sacrifice to resurrect a mad god, maybe don’t make that fight easy? FFT’s a game that can get super silly with unexpected mechanical interplay (hi there, CT5 Holy and holy-absorbing robes!), but even played straight she’s a pushover. All of the demons are, except the first and the one that you get to fight in a one-on-one. \n\nIt’s like Suikoden II’s problem. Nobody in that game holds a candle to Luca Blight and the second half of the game suffers badly for it. (Luca’s also the best RPG boss battle, bar none, and I’ll die on this hill.)', ""Mara from Ghostrunner\n\nShe's immediately intimidating from the opening cinematic of the game and the entire game, you're trying to get to her and kill her. You learn about how powerful she is and I was getting worried because the game is incredibly difficult, surely the final boss will be a major challenge.\n\nThen you get to her and it's a simple game of Simon Says"", ""Queen Myrrah from Gears of War 1-3, gets built up as this huge threat when it was really the Locust Horde that did more while she stayed on the sidelines like Chairman Prescott had until game 3 only to be stabbed to death in the game's ending cutscene."", 'Hogwarts Legacy', 'This is Hella touchy and I know but I\'m gonna say it. I\'m not usually all that put off by villain behaivor but Abby in The Last Of Us Part || really made me feel off.\n\nThis isn\'t because of the reasons that started fights. Her design is fine, the plot is fine, I enjoyed most of it. For me it was just the very minimal growth and responsibility despite the point of the game. \n\n(Don\'t read ahead if you don\'t want spoilers. Not sure if I can mark spoilers on here)\n\nBasically the whole point was Abby and Ellie were basically parallels. Two sides of the same coin in the cycle of revenge and violence. But the longer the game went on the less scenes actually showed any real Remorse or Guilt on Abby\'s side rather than blame. The lines ""I let you live and you wasted it"" and the ending where she told Ellie she was over this, both just showed she never saw herself in Ellie and she never truely felt at fault. Not to mention how willing she was to intentionally kill Dina even though Ellie did it on accident with Alice and it really messed her up. Abby got her wish, but blamed and hated Ellie for trying to retaliate. Nothing to me showed Abby ever changed. No matter what she did or what side she was on, in her mind she was right and everyone else was wrong.\n\nI get the story was meant to get an emotional reaction out of people and I don\'t see it as Bad, I just think they missed the development of Abby that would have sold the story they said they were trying to tell. Especially with writing that has always been great with really in depth character development. Perhaps if they had let players spend more time with who she was before it could be different but as it is, Abby just felt too violent and self centered to be anything more than another cheap ""bad guy"".', 'Vaas Montenegro, Makarov from СoD', ""Seifer in Final Fantasy 8.\n\nHe literally injures Squall in the opening fmv sequence of the game.\n\nMaybe it was just me thinking of the relationship between Cloud and Sepiroth from 7, but i thought from that opening video that Squall and Seifer are on an inevitable collision course with one another.\n\nSure enough, Seifer becomes a bad guy but as the story progresses he's nothing more than a lackey henchman and not much of a key player or threat to the heroes.\n\nI remember feeling really let down that more wasn't done with his character in the game."", 'Every Farcry villain.', 'Skull Face in MGSV, literally popped into my head when I read the title.', 'Silas Volkmire in Battletoads in Battlemaniacs.

Guy is absolutely a freak of a man machine and is talked up the entire game as being a huge threat, but then was rarely in the game. Even worse by the time I got to fight him by the end ( in the path I took) I was over-levelled out of my mind so he was a pushover.\n\nHis presence in the EdgeRunner's anime though worked MUCH better I thought, because he was used as a juxtaposition against the main character and their obsession with getting mods."", ""The Calypsos in borderlands 3. They had so much potential.  Bad guy Sirens. Phaseleech could've been terrifying. Cult leaders, even the streamer aspect was okay. But they were so badly written.
