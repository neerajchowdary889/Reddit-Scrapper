Certainly there's enough failsafes in place to avoid having to roll back to previous because of some update error."", ""I haven't restarted my phone in two years. What's the point?""]"
Android 15 DP2 adds a swipe up feature on the Google Pixel Fold for transitioning apps seamlessly between screens,47,1bkgtnt,https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-fold-swipe-up-to-continue/,,"[""It's crazy that this wasn't included on release or even introduced in 14, it seems like such an obvious feature to have"", ""Basically every single time I see a feature update for stock android I'm amazed at how far behind OneUI it is."", 'Those thick bezels stopped me from buying it\xa0']"

Who do you imagine is going to seek out Google Messages because of their half-baked AI being shoved in?\n\n>The Gemini integration in Google Messages uses RCS but it is not end to end encrypted which is understandable because Google might want some logging data from interactions to Gemini.\n\nAh yes, perfectly ""understandable"".', 'Allo? Allo?', 'Why is this in Google messages. I do not need this in Google messages', ""Gemini is kinda garbage though. I have a buddy that lives in Vietnam and I wanted to see what time it was there since I couldn't remember if it was an 11 or 12 hour difference after daylight savings. I asked what time it was, and it began by giving me the (incorrect) time in PST even though I am in EST. It then proceeded me to give me a Vietnamese time that was some 15 hours obviously wrong.

They will make a great phone that I want to recommend, but then hamstring it the next year so you have to be very specific about which year. The Moto G power from 2020 was great, the 2021 model shrunk the battery and lowered screen resolution, all for the same price. And they do it all the time. Make a great phone and then ruin it the next year by cheapening out."", ""Unfortunately this seems to have a slower GPU than my 2022 Stylus 5g, which is the only component I feel needs an upgrade.
