New patch, new Bug Megathread! To avoid bug reports cluttering the subreddit and/or going unnoticed, a Megathread is posted after every patch so users may submit reports in one place.

# Reporting a Bug

Yes, of course. Is it an easy task - as easy as the solutions that we are currently using simply recording our screen and saving that as a video? Heck no, it will be as stupid as fuck for them to to do this, since not only it doesn\'t capture all the POV (without costing way too much storage space in your disk), but it also impacts the PC performance. And so they have to instead encode the replay ""recordings"" as a series of actions that are being performed by each player during each and every round and the impact that it has on the surroundings so that if they have all the variables with them, they can simply ""redo"" all the actions including having the set seed recorded for the PRNG that they use to determine the spread that some guns will have (since guns in Valorant don\'t exactly have a fixed spray pattern like CS). \nDoing these things without impacting several other things is not an easy task. Again, yes it is doable for sure, but honestly we aren\'t as qualified to comment on how easy task it will be for them to do so. There may be some factors in play that we don\'t even know about, due to which, all we can do is continue requesting riot games to implement this functionality and hope that they do give priority to this feature than, like others said, focus on making new skins.', 'This is cool but we don’t have a replay system because riot doesn’t want us to have one for whatever reason (I am guessing they don’t want to spend money on storing the replays) they are perfectly capable of making one.

That is more important, right?""', 'Pretty sure they don’t want a replay system because we’ll find out how infested the game is with cheaters lol', 'the problem is vanguard', 'my theory is that it has something to do with valorants fog of war', 'I\'m not giving Riot Games the benefit of the doubt here, but I just have to say that the software devs themselves are **not** lazy.\n\nMost, if not all, software developers are actually super ambitious. If you speak to any of them about solving a problem with a software solution, they\'ll always give you something back that solves the problem and then some. That\'s because it\'s fun for them to break a problem down, solve it, then build it. \n\nWhat holds back software developers and their ambitions are: **time**, **money** and most importantly **management**. I can assure you that the software developers are Riot Games are itching at the thought of adding a replay system, or a boat load of other awesome features, and they\'d be able to do it before you know it. They just can\'t because:\n\n1. Time - they have a set amount of time to complete their tasks for each ""sprint"" planned, meaning they can\'t be ambitious and stuff gets rushed. This results in something called ""technical debt"" where poor quality solutions are added to software due to time, which eventually catches up with you later on. \n\n2. Money - their teams aren\'t allocated enough funds to research, develop and create what they want. This goes hand-in-hand with time, because funds are allocated on how long something will take to make.\n\n3. Management - the biggest bane of every software developer\'s existence. They don\'t understand *how* something is made or *how* it works, they just want it made, period. Anything else suggested by the team is irrelevant to the budget and timeframe given by themselves. \n\nSo, it\'s easy to make something in Unreal Engine in your bedroom because you basically have unlimited time, nothing to fund and no management breathing down your neck and forcing you to push work out under scrutiny - but it\'s a lot harder for software devs to spread their wings in an office-environment, especially for game development. Believe me, they take what they can get.', ""They can't do it. That would let EVERYBODY show how flawed this game can get. There is somethings Riot is trying to hide. From aim assist claims to blatant cheaters. It IS EASY to implement. Indeed. It would just be TERRIBLE for Riot's name and it is obvious at this point."", 'Again one of those ""its so easy"" guys. I could write an essay why this is bs. Tired of college kids using pre-built tools claiming look how easy it is! When they have no real life experience how big custom made stuff work', 'reddit when different departments', 'For how often people say ""reynas smurfing"" it would honestly suck up a lot of peoples time. They would get mad and spend twice as long in a match they didnt enjoy because they are busy analyzing the reynas pov only to get even more angry.\n\nImo it will add toxicity becaude your party members will leave your sessions just to boil in the saltwater that was their previous match.\n\nI see the benefits. There are so many things you could learn from it. But from a mental health standpoint, i find people will be using replays the wrong way.']"
