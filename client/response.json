        "1. Withdraw your booked profit from your trading account. I do this on a daily basis if I earn some profit. It helps in controlling the total capital at risk.\n2. Don't increase your capital until you invest a good amount of time in understanding different market situations. At least try for the next 3-6 months with the same capital or a small capital that you can afford to lose.\n3. Use a stop loss every time. It is easy to blow up your entire trading account in one trade. Even you earned a lot of profit in first four trade, and if you put all of money at risk in fifth trade, then you can loose all of your money. (getting 5/5 is difficult, and even if you manage to get 5/5 -> 9/9 then in 10th trade you loose all of your money, then your profit will be nil). so managing risk is most importnat.",
